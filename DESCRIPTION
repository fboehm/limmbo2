Description: limmbo2 is a R wrapper for the python module limmbo. limmbo performs covariance estimation for the multivariate linear mixed effects model, vec(Y) = X vec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E), where E and G are both matrix-variate normally distributed. The method relies on combination of multiple covariance matrix estimates from bootstrapped subsets of the phenotypes.
